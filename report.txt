SVFS's report
=============

Objectives
----------

1. Learn basics of VFS APIs
2. Getting familiar with FUSE (the Filesystem in USErspace) by implementing a Simple Versioning File system (SVFS)


About FUSE
----------

The filesystem is untrusted the mission to store and organise files, within a computer, while keeping their access and use easy. At the kernel level, developping a filesystem requires quite a good knowledge of the operating system internals and should be done with great care of security issues. FUSE is a fully implemented filesystem that provides a simple API, stability and security. With FUSE, one may develop a filesystem at the application level, decreasing drastically the complexity.

About SVFS
----------

A Virtual FileSystem (VFS) is a filesystem (really?) created on top of an existing filesystem. It's exactly what the FUSE API is made for! In this project we make use of FUSE to create a backed up filesystem, which we'll call SVFS standing for Simple Virtual FileSystem.

"SVFS will keep backups of every changed file for the next N (say 10) minutes. Hence, all files that are saved with unwanted changes, or accidentally deleted for instance, can be easily retrieved" (quoted frome the assignment).

About our experience
--------------------

Working with FUSE and filesystems in general was an enlightment. There is a lot of possibilities to use this knowlodge outside of this course project and we now feel closer to our beloved operating system.
